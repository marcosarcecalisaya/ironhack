DOM Exercise: To-Do List

Time to start practicing manipulating the DOM! In this exercise, you are going to make a To-Do list for yourself.

Download the exercise files and open index.html.

You’ll see that you have the HTML for a list. I’ve already added some items for you! But as you can see, the ‘Save’ and ‘Done’ buttons don’t do anything (yet).

Your job is to write the functions that will make the buttons useful.

The ‘Save’ button should take the value from the input field and add it as a new li to the To-Do list.

The ‘Done’ button should remove the first list item from the To-Do list and add it to the Done list. Remember to add the correct class to get the strikethrough.
